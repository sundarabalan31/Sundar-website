  <p>
    I am a remote sensing scientist specializing in ocean satellite remote sensing and aquatic optics. 
    Currently, I serve as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Massachusetts Boston, where my work focuses on 
    hyperspectral modeling of kelp forests and machine learning frameworks for water quality retrieval.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously, I held research positions at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (UMD) and GESTAR-II, UMBC, 
    contributing to projects on radiative transfer modeling and satellite image analysis of inland and coastal waters. 
    I earned my Ph.D. in Ocean Engineering from IIT Madras, India, where my doctoral research focused on 
    underwater light field modeling and optical property retrieval.

  <p>
    My broader research vision integrates satellite, drone, and in-situ observations with data-driven methods to better understand aquatic ecosystem processes and their variability under changing environmental conditions.
